# Codixfy UI
This is a new project under development, but it's expected to be the components library with more components in the web for ReactJS/NextJS.

This project is being inspired by some ui libraries like Shadcn (structure & code customization), Preline (design language), PrimeReact (components selection).

Check the project page for the current workflow.
