Please, be mindful, this project is on extremely early stages of development. It is not ready for production use.

## What is this project about?
This project will be an open-source modern styled NextJS-optimized components
library.

It is expected to include a wide range of components, from simple buttons to complex data tables/sidebars, etc.

It will also include ready-to-use page/webapps blocks, so you can deploy a complete styled page or web applications 
in a couple of hours, just joining blocks like lego pieces.

## Why another component library?

1. This is NextJS focused and optimized, using things like next-themes, next-links, next-image, etc.
2. It is expected to be as completed as PrimeReact, good-looking like Preline, and code-level customizable as Shadcn.
3. It is SEO optimized, and complies with the latest web standards.
4. It supports server-side rendering on all the components that doesn't need client-side interaction.
5. It is open-source and free to use, even for commercial projects.

## When will it be available?
I'm working on it on my free time, so I can't give you a precise date. But I'm working hard to release it as soon as possible.

You can check out the "Projects" tab to see the current status of the project.

## How can I help?
You can help by:
- Giving feedback on the components you would like to see in the library.
- Reporting bugs.
- Contributing to the codebase.
- Sharing the project with your friends and colleagues.

## Important
Be advised that all the components to this date are alpha, which means that syntax and codebase can, and will likely change.

Once we move a components set to beta, we will keep the syntax, just adding new features, but maintaining retro-compatibility.
